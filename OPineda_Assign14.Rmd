This week, we’ll work out some Taylor Series expansions of popular functions.

• f(x) = 1/(1−x)
• f(x) = e^x
• f(x) = ln(1 + x)

For each function, only consider its valid ranges as indicated in the notes when you are computing the Taylor Series expansion. Please submit your assignment as a R-Markdown document.

1. For f(x) = 1/(1-x), we have the following:

$$f(x) = 1/(1-x)$$
$$f'(x) = 1/(1-x)^2$$
$$f''(x) = 2/(1-x)^3$$
$$f'''(x) = 6/(1-x)^4$$
$$f^{n}(x) = n!/(1-x)^{n+1}$$
$$f^{n}(0) = n!$$
Next, we use the Taylor Series formula to get

$$1/(1-x) = \sum f^{n}(0)/n! *x^n = \sum n!/n! *x^n = \sum x^n $$

2. For f(x) = e^x, we have the following:

$$f(x) = e^x$$
$$f'(x) = e^x$$
$$f''(x) = e^x$$
$$f'''(x) = e^x$$
$$f^{n}(x) = e^x$$
$$f^{n}(0) = 1$$
Next, we use the Taylor Series formula to get

$$e^x = \sum f^{n}(0)/n! *x^n = \sum 1/n! *x^n $$
3. For f(x) = ln(1 + x), we have the following:

$$f(x) = ln(1 + x)$$
$$f'(x) = 1/(1+x)$$
$$f''(x) = -1/(1+x)^2$$
$$f'''(x) = 2/(1+x)^3$$
$$f^{n}(x) = (-1)^{n-1}*(n-1)!/(1+x)^n$$
$$f^{n}(0) = (-1)^{n-1}*(n-1)!$$
Next, we use the Taylor Series formula to get

$$ln(1 + x) = \sum f^{n}(0)/n! *x^n = \sum (-1)^{n-1}*(n-1)!/n! *x^n $$
